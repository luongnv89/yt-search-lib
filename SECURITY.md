## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of YouTube Search seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, please report it to us by following these steps:

1. Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) (Please replace with actual security contact if available).
2. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and the potential impact.
3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

### What to expect

- We will work with you to understand the scope and impact of the issue.
- We will keep you informed of our progress as we work on a fix.
- We will provide a public disclosure of the vulnerability once a fix is available, giving you credit for the discovery if you wish.

Thank you for helping keep YouTube Search secure!
